Code generation process
==================
The code generation process uses template files for the selected target. 
These template files contain tokens that refer to information from the model. 
During the code generation process these tokens are replaced with the 
actual information from the model. The resulting files are placed in the target
directory. The following files from the template are generated for in this target directory:

Target files
========
readme.txt
	this file

yaw_xxmain.c
	an example main loop that calls the submodel function

yaw_xxsubmod.h
yaw_xxsubmod.c
	the function that calls the model and the integration process

yaw_xxmodel.h
